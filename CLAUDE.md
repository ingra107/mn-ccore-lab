## Design System

### Design Ethos: Operational, Not Editorial (Decision: 2026-04-01)

The Hub is a **research operations center**, not a magazine. Every design choice prioritizes usability and data clarity over decoration. Read `Context/Decisions/2026-04-01_hub-design-ethos-pivot.md` (PB repo) for full rationale.

**Core principles (NEVER violate):**
1. **Dark-first design.** Dark bg is deep neutral (#0b1017), NOT blue-tinted. Text is #e2e8f0 (not pure white — less glare). Light mode secondary.
2. **Columnar tables, not card stacks.** Data pages use fixed-column tables with headers (Title|Assignee|Due|Status|Priority). Cards are for dashboards only. Fixed row height for vertical scanning.
3. **Inline editability with visible affordance.** Every editable field shows "▾" dropdown indicator. Click cell → dropdown/picker by type. Auto-save on blur. No explicit save button. (Research: Pattern 4)
4. **Typography: light weight, three opacity tiers.** Body font-weight: 400. Active text: 100% opacity. Normal: 70% (--ink = #e2e8f0). Muted: 55% (--muted = `rgba(148,163,184,0.55)`). NEVER use opacity below 0.5 on readable text in dark mode. NEVER 500+ weight for body text. Weight hierarchy: body=400, label/subtitle=500, card metrics=700, heading h1=600.
5. **One accent color per view.** Teal for interactive. Everything else neutral. Max 2 non-neutral colors per view.
6. **More info, more readable.** Density ≠ clutter. LabSync puts 20 sidebar items that are MORE readable than our 17. The secret: font-weight 400, grouped sections with rhythm, consistent icon opacity.
7. **Zero monospace in content.** JetBrains Mono for `<kbd>` only. ALL other text is DM Sans.
8. **Optimistic UI + undo.** State changes are instant. Undo toast for 5 seconds. Never show spinners for actions. (Research: Pattern 9)
9. **Click targets must be precise.** Clicking a task row opens detail panel. ONLY clicking the status circle changes status. Hover actions hidden until hover (pointer-events:none at opacity:0).

### Fonts
- **Portal titles:** DM Sans (clean, operational)
- **Public website titles:** Fraunces (editorial, brand voice)
- **Body text:** DM Sans everywhere
- **Code only:** JetBrains Mono
- **CSS:** `--font-sans` and `--font-body` both resolve to DM Sans. `--font-display` = Fraunces (public pages only).

### Palette
- **Light:** bg white `#ffffff` / ink `#0f1923` / slate `#2c3e50`
- **Dark:** bg `#0b1017` / ink `#e2e8f0` / slate `#94a3b8` (neutral, not blue-tinted)
- **Accents:** gold `#c9a84c` / teal `#2d8a8a` / maroon `#7a0019` / orange `#c2410c` / green `#16a34a`
- **Containers:** light `#f5f5f5` / dark `#111820`
- Category dots: 6px, 0.7 opacity -- maroon=CLIF, teal=Lab, gold=Mesfin

### Table Pattern (apply to ALL data pages)
- Bordered container with subtle border and small radius
- Column headers: uppercase, 11px, 0.5 opacity, 0.06em letter-spacing
- Stage group headers: quiet uppercase labels with extending rule line
- Row hover: gold-tinted `rgba(201, 168, 76, 0.06)`, active at `0.10`
- Inline controls: status/priority dropdowns editable in-row
- Ghost-style action buttons (outline, not filled)

### Micro-interactions (standardize to 2 constants)
- `--transition-fast: 150ms` — hover, toggle, status change, row highlight
- `--transition-panel: 250ms` — sidebar, detail panel, modal, card shadow
- Card hover: -1px lift.
- Inline durations standardized to 150ms (fast) / 250ms (panel) as of 2026-04-05.

### Sidebar
- Font-weight 400 for nav items, 500 for active only
- Active: teal bg fill, no left border. Inactive: --slate color, icon opacity 0.7.
- Section labels: 9px uppercase, opacity 0.5. Divider lines between groups.
- Row height: py-2 (compact). Font: 12px. Group gap: 4px. Section divider margin: 6px/8px.
- Logo: mark uses CSS filter for dark mode (`invert(1) brightness(1.5)`), text logo swaps to dark variant.

### Borders & Spacing
- `--border-light` (gold tint) = semantic. `--border-subtle` (neutral) = structural. Don't mix.
- Spacing: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32px grid. No off-grid values.

### UX Research Patterns (from task-management-ux-patterns-research.md)

Must-reference before building ANY new feature. Key implementable patterns:
- **Pattern 4 (Inline Editing):** Click any field → edit mode by type (dropdown/picker/text). Auto-save on blur.
- **Pattern 7 (List View):** Fixed row height. Column headers. Grouping with collapsible headers. Density toggle.
- **Pattern 9 (Optimistic UI):** Instant state changes. Undo toast for 5 seconds. Never show spinners.
- **Pattern 10 (Micro-interactions):** Completion animation. Status color transitions. Progressive disclosure.
- **Pattern 3 (Three depth levels):** Peek (Space) → Side Panel (click) → Full Page (Enter). Decision tree in research doc.

Competitive reference: LabSync (JC Rojas) — friend, learn from, never compete.

### Shared Utilities
- `src/lib/dateUtils.ts` (formatters), `src/data/team.ts:getPersonInfo()`, `formatBrandName()` from BrandName.tsx

## Architecture

```
Airtable ←CRDT→ brain.db ←LWW→ D1 (mnccore-lab) ←API→ React + TanStack Query
                   ↑                    ↑
            Nick's CLI              Team's Hub
          (single user)          (20+ team members)
```

- **Data:** TanStack Query v5 → D1 API (prod), static TS fallback (dev)
- **API:** Cloudflare Worker, 110+ endpoints, auth-gated writes
- **Auth:** Open now. Cloudflare Access for April 21 launch (@umn.edu)
- **Email:** Worker cron + SendGrid (dormant -- needs API key)
- **Sync:** `sync_d1_push.py` / `sync_d1_pull.py` in PB, scheduled + /process-triggered

### Sync Architecture (Decision: 2026-04-06)

brain.db is the **sync hub**. Airtable and D1 never talk directly — changes propagate through brain.db.

**Sync model:** Field-level last-write-wins (LWW) with timestamps. Both D1 and brain.db are authoritative — whoever changed a field last wins. Conflicts logged to `sync_log`.

**Sync triggers:**
- /process: push to D1 (step 4b) + pull from D1 (step 0c)
- Scheduled: 2:35 AM push, 2:40 AM pull, 12:05 PM push+pull
- Machine swap: Airtable only (not D1)

**Key rules:**
- Brain.db tasks use `recXXX` IDs (Airtable). Hub-created tasks use hex IDs. Both coexist.
- Hub-created tasks pull to brain.db but do NOT push to Airtable (Airtable is Nick-only).
- `notes` (brain.db) is private. `description` (D1) is team-visible. They do NOT sync bidirectionally.
- Task deletion uses soft-delete (`deleted_at` column) to prevent zombie re-creation.
- `completed` field is bidirectional — Hub can reopen tasks, brain.db accepts it.

**Implementation:** See plan at `~/.claude/plans/graceful-meandering-thimble.md`
**Peripheral Brain sync scripts:** `scripts/db/sync_d1_push.py`, `sync_d1_pull.py`

## Critical Rules

1. **Content visible by default.** `.fade-in-up` starts at opacity:1. NEVER hide content behind animations.
2. **Hero cards use `<a>` tags**, not React Router `<Link>`. AnimatePresence + useCountUp conflict.
3. **initialData as factory functions.** `initialData: () => data`, never `initialData: data`.
4. **Avatar:** Container `overflow-hidden`, img `w-full h-full`.
5. **`getPersonInfo()` from `src/data/team.ts`** -- never create local copies.
6. **Date formatting from `src/lib/dateUtils.ts`** -- never create local formatters.
7. **@mentions use `MentionInput`** -- not raw `<textarea>`.
8. **Dedup action items** -- normalize "[Carried forward]" prefix.
9. **NEVER deploy from a worktree.** Commit to branch + PR only.
10. **ONE deploy per session.** KV free tier limit. Batch all work, deploy once.
11. **`formatBrandName()`** for any text that might contain "MNCCORE".
12. **Tailwind v4:** `@import` syntax, not `@tailwind`. No `group-hover:` with arbitrary values -- use CSS rules.

## Roadmap

**Phases 1-13: COMPLETE** (360+ commits). See `REFERENCE.md` for details.

**Phase 14: COMPLETE** (7 commits). Design ethos pivot — palette, containers, inline editing, fonts, monospace, colors.

**Phase 15: COMPLETE** (1 commit). Project detail → tabbed workspace.

**Phase 16: COMPLETE** (10 commits). LabSync parity push — foundation + tables:
- Dark bg deepened #0b1017, text softened #e2e8f0, body weight 400
- TaskGridView: columnar table (Title|Assignee|Due|Status|Priority) with inline editing
- Deadlines + Ideas: converted to columnar tables
- SectionHeader, ToggleButton, MetricCard, BentoCard: lighter weights
- Undo toast system, workload visibility, task click bug fix
- CLAUDE.md: 9 design principles from LabSync + UX research

**Phase 20: COMPLETE** (12 commits + simplify). UX polish & interaction:
- HoverCard: preview cards on hover (project/member/task), wired to 6 surfaces
- TaskContextMenu: right-click for quick actions with submenus
- Toast system: success confirmations for 8 key mutations + timeout cleanup
- ActivityHeatmap on MemberPage, stagger animations (Dashboard + Projects)
- J/K keyboard nav on Projects page, role-based dashboard views (PI/Fellow/Coordinator)
- Design ethos enforcement: heading weights fixed across 57 files
- Simplify: shared constants (lib/taskConstants.ts, lib/animations.ts), memoized Personal.tsx

**Phase 20.5: Mobile Responsive** (1 commit from home laptop, d65d71c):
- Stacked card layout on mobile, columnar grid on desktop (Projects, Manuscripts, Deadlines, Ideas)
- InlineSelect larger touch targets, global CSS 36px min touch targets

**Phase 20.6: Quick Fixes** (2026-04-03):
- Fixed: Portal h1 fonts changed from Fraunces to DM Sans (Dashboard, Projects)
- Fixed: Duplicate action item empty states on Meetings page

**Phase 21: COMPLETE** (13 commits + expert playbook). Visual perfection:
- Blocks 0-5: Spring physics, progressive disclosure (F key), column sort, empty states, transition constants, welcome banner, meeting prep view
- Tier 1.5: TaskDetailPanel split, Sidebar perf, dynamic import cleanup, fontFamily purge (1107 across 131 files), loading skeletons (9 pages), taskConfig consolidation, inline editing expansion, undo toast expansion, J/K nav (5 pages), HoverCards (6 surfaces), stagger animations (4 pages)
- Hardcoded white audit: confirmed correct (white-on-accent), no changes needed

**Post-Phase 21: Showcase Features** (2026-04-04, 5 deploys):
- **Inline subtask expand/collapse** (81da23b): Linear-style chevrons on TaskGridView. AnimatePresence expand with progress bar, inline toggle, add input. Keyboard: → expand, ← collapse (directional, not toggle). Auto-focus input on expand.
- **Meeting NLP action items** (ce04ebf): Inline quick-add on MeetingDetail. Type `@nick Review draft p2 Friday` → parses assignee, priority, due date, project via `parseQuickAddInput`. Token preview chips. Creates task linked to meeting with `meeting_id`. Invalidates meeting query for instant refresh.
- **Accessibility** (be80679): CommandPalette focus trapping + aria-modal. CreateTaskModal focus trapping + aria-modal. UndoToast `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"`. ShortcutHelp spring animation + aria-modal.
- **Dashboard 6-card default** (b502053): Default role showed 2 cards (upcoming+stats). Now shows 6 (action-board, upcoming, project-health, pipeline, activity, stats). localStorage version key resets stale preferences.
- **Meeting dedup** (6a1fd06): API dedup by date+title before INSERT. UNIQUE index on meetings(date, title). Cleaned 123 duplicates from D1 (139→16).

**Phase 23: COMPLETE** (14 commits, 2026-04-06). UX depth + a11y + undo-everywhere sprint:
- **Clickable task titles everywhere**: clicking title opens TaskDetailPanel on Tasks, MyTasks, Personal, Deadlines, ProjectDetail
- **Undo on EVERY status change**: TaskGridView, TaskStandUpView, TaskDetailPanel, Tasks, MyTasks, Personal, Deadlines, Dashboard ActionBoard, MeetingDetail, ProjectDetail, MyItems, Meetings
- **TaskDetailPanel wired to all views**: Grid, Board, StandUp, Timeline views on both Tasks and MyTasks pages, plus Personal, Deadlines, ProjectDetail
- Hover actions moved to own grid column (no longer overlaps priority)
- Project notes system: Notes section reads from project_updates table (timestamped, auto-author)
- Deadlines: InlineSelect for task status, clickable task titles, TaskDetailPanel
- Focus trapping + Escape key on all 6 modals
- J/K keyboard nav on 5 more pages (Grants, Search, MeetingNotes, Narratives + Enter on Search)
- Stagger animations on Analytics, PIAnalytics, Settings
- EmptyState on Settings workflow templates
- PageHeader: aria-live on count/subtitle for screen readers
- Success toasts on task creation, idea capture, answer submission
- Removed 366 redundant fontFamily declarations across 77 files
- TaskStandUpView: separated status circle from title click with undo
- TaskTimelineView: bar click opens detail panel instead of cycling status

**Phase 24: COMPLETE** (database alignment, 2026-04-06). brain.db ↔ D1 full sync:
- **Phase A** (bulk load): 537 brain.db tasks → D1 via `POST /api/tasks/sync-bulk`. `scripts/sync-brain-tasks.ts` with `--api`/`--sql` modes. recXXX IDs preserved. `assignee` column added to brain.db.
- **Phase B** (ongoing sync): schema-v22 (`updated_at` + `deleted_at`), all 5 write paths set `updated_at`, batch delete → soft-delete, `updated_since` delta filter. `sync_d1_push.py` and `sync_d1_pull.py` rewritten for field-level LWW from main tasks table. `crdt.py` monotonic constraint relaxed for task reopening.
- **Sync flow:** `/process` runs push+pull. Scheduled 2:35 AM push, 2:40 AM pull. Delta sync via `updated_at` timestamps.
- **Admin endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/migrate` for schema changes without wrangler D1 access.

**Phase 25: COMPLETE** (2026-04-06). Showcase + academic workflow features:
- Virtual scrolling on TaskGridView (@tanstack/react-virtual) — 537 tasks performant
- AI autofill on CreateTaskModal — heuristic project/priority/assignee suggestions
- **Paper Revision Tracker** (schema-v23): per-round reviewer comments, progress bars, ProjectDetail tab
- **Mentee Milestone Dashboard** (schema-v24): /mentee-milestones page, MemberPage integration, PI overview
- **Deadline Cascade View** (schema-v25): dependency graph, impact simulation, /deadline-cascade page
- **Paper Submission Lifecycle** (schema-v26): submission events timeline, active submissions widget
- **IRB/Regulatory Tracking** (schema-v27): regulatory items, expiration alerts on Personal page

**Phase 26: COMPLETE** (2 commits, 2026-04-07). UX audit from LabSync comparison — 14 issues:
- Dark mode sidebar logo fix (filter + dark SVG variant)
- Remove "Join" nav tab, rethink hero pathway cards (Collaborate→/network, Meet Our Team→/team)
- Default task sort changed from priority → due_date (TaskGridView + MyTasks)
- MyTasks: showCompleted toggle, useAuth() hook (replaces manual JWT parsing)
- --muted opacity raised 0.4→0.55, dark mode contrast audit across 22 files
- Sidebar compactness: py-2, 12px font, tighter group gaps
- Task click fix in MyTasks grouped view (virtualizer minHeight)
- Projects: PI + Group columns inline-editable (InlineSelect), sortable column headers
- Projects: stage group headers only show when sorted by stage
- All Tasks: "My Tasks" filter toggle
- **TaskDetailPanel**: restructured to 4-tab layout (Overview/Details/Files/Comments)
- **Link Paper to Project**: search modal on ProjectLiterature with publication picker
- **Publication Library View**: horizontal scrolling journal cover cards (scroll-snap)

## Accessibility Requirements

Currently good: aria-hidden on icons, aria-label on interactive elements, aria-pressed on toggles, skip-to-content link, focus-visible styling, prefers-reduced-motion in 5 locations, all modals have focus trapping + Escape key + aria-modal.

**All major gaps closed as of Phase 23:**
- ~~UndoToast needs `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"`~~ DONE (be80679)
- ~~CommandPalette needs focus trapping~~ DONE (81da23b)
- ~~CreateTaskModal needs focus trapping~~ DONE (be80679)
- ~~CreateProjectModal needs focus trapping~~ DONE
- ~~CreateIdeaModal, CreateQuestionModal, CreateDecisionModal, TranscriptModal need focus trapping~~ DONE (Phase 23)
- ~~No `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates~~ DONE — PageHeader count/subtitle have aria-live
- ~~Toast notifications not announced to screen readers~~ DONE — UndoToast container has role="status" + aria-live, success toasts share same container

## Known Gotchas

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Hero cards render loop | Use `<a>` tags, not Router Link |
| initialData flash | Use factory functions: `() => data` |
| Meeting ID collision | IDs include random suffix. API dedup by date+title prevents duplicates. UNIQUE index enforced. |
| Tailwind v4 group-hover | Use CSS rule in index.css, not arbitrary value |
| --border-light vs --border-subtle | Gold=semantic, Neutral=structural. Don't mix. |
| TaskCard status cycling | todo→in_progress→done (skips blocked) |
| Network chunk 1.3MB | Expected (three.js). Code-split via React.lazy |
| CF Access blocks all | Restrict to portal paths only |
| Duplicate action items | Dedup by normalizing "[Carried forward]" |
