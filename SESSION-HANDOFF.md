## What shipped this session (2026-05-22) — verify-first batch

Nick: "do Batch 1 + Batch 2 + schema migrations, but verify each is still needed first." Verification killed 4 of 9 backend items as already-fixed and deferred 3 of 5 schema items as dead columns. Net 8 real changes shipped + deployed.

**`3bd5d419` — 5 backend correctness fixes (Batch 1+2):**
- SEC-4 timezone DST (`pb-sector.ts` + `digest-email.ts` → `Intl.DateTimeFormat('America/Chicago', h23')`)
- SEC-6 project FK resolver on pb-sector capture
- DAT-3 `/api/tasks/batch` returns `{ok,count,applied,failed}` (additive)
- DAT-6 meeting-notes 404 on missing meeting
- DAT-8 regulatory renew wrapped in `env.DB.batch()`

**`9eb9b192` + `5483d30b` — D7 (`projects.stage_entered_at`, fixes FAKE-5):** schema-v68 (Hub-only) + frontend surface + `daysInStage` fix. The write engine (co-flip in `applyPatch`, fires on any stage transition) lives in `8990acb7` — see heads-up below.

**`1c40fa2a` — D22 (typed activity_log events):** stage_change, pi_change, project_rename, assignee_change, role_assignment. No schema needed (table existed).

**Verified ALREADY-FIXED / deferred (no work):** DAT-1 (PK_COLUMN map), DAT-2 (ALLOWED_TABLES), DAT-5 (404/400 guards). D8/D9/D28 deferred — dead columns until their features are built. `meeting_cancel` N/A — no cancel handler.

**Then: Codex audit + audit-fix batch.** Ran a `/codex-cli` state audit (synthesis: `Scratch/codex-state-audit-2026-05-22/synthesis.md`). It caught real misses, all verified + fixed in **`6a69cfb2`** (deploy `4681a29c`):
- **advanceProjectMovement** matched `WHERE id=?` only, but tasks store project *slug* → silently never advanced `last_meaningful_movement` (regression in `8990acb7`). Now `id=? OR slug=?`.
- **D7 new-project hole** — `handleCreateProject` didn't set `stage_entered_at` → new projects NULL → bug recurred. Now set on insert.
- **SEC-5 was wrongly dismissed** — random UUID per submit meant double-click made duplicate inbox rows. Now a stable per-draft id reused across retries (server `ON CONFLICT(id)` dedups).
- **Manuscripts status enum** — UI sent `pending`/`completed` the server rejects → silent revert. Aligned to `active/waiting_external/blocked/done` (both dropdowns).
- **D22 batch-assign** now emits `assignee_change` (was single-task only).

## ⚠️ Heads-up for next session

1. **A background `builder` agent committed AND pushed to this repo concurrently** (`8990acb7` advanceProjectMovement, 09:49). Its commit wasn't path-explicit, so it **swept this session's D7 `applyPatch` co-flip into it** — that's why the stage_entered_at write engine is in a commit labeled "advance project movement." Code is correct, `ingra107`-authored, no Claude attribution. But: if a builder agent is running, coordinate / expect concurrent commits. (The slug/id bug `8990acb7` introduced in advanceProjectMovement was caught by the Codex audit + fixed in `6a69cfb2`.) Still-open follow-up from that commit: `stale_active_since` NULL doesn't pull back to brain.db (hub.py `_w1col` truthy gate skips NULL) — companion fix needed for full symmetry.
2. **Test D1 (`mnccore-lab-test`) is drifted** — missing schema-v55 columns (`last_meaningful_movement` et al.). Surfaced when v68's original backfill referenced one. Pre-existing; worth a janitor/schema-sync pass to bring test D1 current with prod.

## Prior session — 2026-05-15 (13 commits)

Security (digest XSS/escapeHtml, GET API auth lockdown, admin endpoints deleted, PB POST PI-gating, upload R2 integrity), data/naming fixes (ProjectDetail archive, Manuscripts categories → 3-bucket, digest enums, search comment join, v66 `hub_decisions` rename), UX (folder-link drive letters, mnccore-handler, transcript honesty), and the CLAUDE.md diet + WORKPLAN creation. Full detail in `CHANGELOG.md` + git history. **NOT fixed (intentional):** project delete cascade swallow-and-continue (documented design decision, `projects.cascade.test.ts` B-CRIT-05).

## Next Session Playbook

**▶ Nick's directive (2026-05-22): fresh look → do the T1 correctness fixes → THEN a fresh Codex audit (as the verification gate).** NOT audit-first — the T1 batch is already audit-derived, and Codex's highest-value use is gating just-shipped work (the 2026-05-22 audit ran after a batch and caught 4 real flaws). For the judgment-heavy items (CT date sweep ~30 sites, STATE-1), grep-validate the approach before executing. Full ordering + rationale in `WORKPLAN.md` "▶ NEXT SESSION". Prior synthesis: `Scratch/codex-state-audit-2026-05-22/synthesis.md`. Queue: CT date helper sweep, entity status-enum drift audit, STATE-1/STATE-2, DAT-4 (verify first), test-D1 repair.

### Schema Queue

| ID | What | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| D7 | `projects.stage_entered_at` | ✅ DONE 2026-05-22 (schema-v68, Hub-only) |
| D22 | `activity_log` typed emits | ✅ DONE 2026-05-22 (no schema; 5 typed events) |
| D8 | `lab_questions.tags` | DEFERRED — build with AskTheLab tag-filter feature |
| D9 | `commitments.to_slug` | DEFERRED — build with MyItems commitment tracker |
| D28 | `meetings.start_time/end_time` | DEFERRED — build with time-aware Calendar |

### Manual Items (Nick-owned)

1. **Register mnccore:// on home machine** — `regedit /s "C:\Users\ingra\mn-ccore-lab\scripts\setup-mnccore-protocol.reg"` (note: home user is `ingra`, work is `ingra107` — check the .reg path matches)
2. **CF Access cleanup** — remove preset Google IdP from CF Access app (Generic OIDC `Google UMN` is canonical)
3. **Team adoption push** — security fixes are deployed. Tell the team when ready.
4. **Kill AskHermes coach ref** — remove mention from CLAUDE.md if still there (per decision 5)
